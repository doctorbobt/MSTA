# Lab: Monitoring services deployed to Azure
# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course as soon as the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.**

    1.  In the **Duration** field, enter **10**.
    
    1.  Select **Configure Test Using**.

1.  In the **Configure test using** blade, perform the following actions:
    
    1.  In the **Test Type** list, select **Manual Test**.
    
    1.  In the **URL** field, update the URL by appending the suffix **/api/values** to the end of the current URL.

        > **Note**: For example, if your URL is http://smpapistudent.azurewebsites.net, the new URL would be http://smpapistudent.azurewebsites.net/api/values.

    1.  Select **Done**.

1.  Back in the **New performance test** blade, select **Run test**.

1.  Back in the **Performance test** section, in the list of **Recent runs,** select **LoadTest**.

1. In the **LoadTest** blade, wait for the test to start before you proceed with the lab.

    > **Note**: Most load tests take about 10 to 15 minutes to gather the resources and start. You can wait at this blade because it will automatically refresh when the load testing is started.

1. Wait for the load test to finish before you proceed with the lab. Observe the live chart updating as your Web App experiences increased usage.

    > **Note**: The load test will take the 10 minutes you specified in the previous steps of the lab.

#### Task 2: Use Azure Monitor metrics after performance test

1.  In the left navigation pane of the Azure portal, select **All services**.

1.  In the **All services** blade, select **Monitor**.

1.  In the **Monitor** blade, on the left side of the blade, select **Metrics**.

1.  In the **Metrics** section, perform the following actions:
    
    1.  In the **Resource** section, select **Select a resource**.
    
    1.  In the **Select a resource** window that appears, in the **Resource group** list, select **MonitoredAssets**. Then, in the **Resource** list, select the **instrm\*** Application Insights account option. Finally, select **Apply** to close the window and confirm your selection.
    
    1.  In the **Metric Namespace** list, in the **Standard** category, select **Standard metrics (preview)**.
    
    1.  In the **Metric** list, in the **Performance Counter** category, select **Process CPU**.
    
    1.  In the **Aggregation** list, select **Avg**.
    
    1.  At the top of the section, select **Last 24 hours (Automatic - 5 minutes)**. In the window that appears, in the **Time range** category, select **Last 30 minutes** and then select **Apply** to save your selection.
    
    1.  At the top of the section, select **Line chart**. In the menu that appears, select **Area chart**.

1.  Observe your newly created chart.

1.  At the top of the section, select **Add metric**.

1.  In the **Metrics** section, perform the following actions with the new metric item in the list:
    
    1.  In the **Metric Namespace** list, in the **Standard** category, select **Log-based metrics**.
    
    1.  In the **Metric** list, in the **Server** category, select **Server response time**.
    
    1. In the **Aggregation** list, select **Avg**.

1.  Observe your updated chart. Observe the information displayed in your chart. You can observe how the server response time correlates with the CPU time as load on the application increased.

#### Review

In this exercise, you performed a performance (load) test of your Web App by using the tools available to you in Azure. After you performed the load test, you were able to measure your API app’s behavior by using metrics in the Azure Monitor interface.

### Exercise 5: Clean up subscription 

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell

1.  At the top of the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than symbol and underscore character.

1.  If this is your first time opening the **Cloud Shell** by using your subscription, a **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell Wizard** will appear that allows you to configure **Cloud Shell** for first-time usage. Perform the following actions in the wizard:
    
    1.  A dialog box will appear that prompts you to create a new Storage Account to begin using the shell. Accept the default settings and select **Create storage**.
    
    1.  Wait for the **Cloud Shell** to finish its first-time setup procedures before moving forward with the lab.

    > **Note**: If you do not see the configuration options for the **Cloud Shell**, this is most likely because you are using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written from the presumption that you are using a new subscription.

1.  At the bottom of the portal in the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, type the following command and press Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```powershell
    az group list
    ```

1.  Type the following command and press Enter to view a list of possible commands to delete a resource group:

    ```powershell
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  Type the following command and press Enter to delete the **MonitoredAssets** resource group:

    ```powershell
    az group delete --name MonitoredAssets --no-wait --yes
    ```
    
1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane at the bottom of the portal.

#### Task 3: Close active applications

1.  Close the currently running **Microsoft Edge** application.

1.  Close the currently running **Visual Studio Code** application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the **resource groups** used in this lab.
